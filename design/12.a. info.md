## **Key Sections:**

### **1-2. Security Model & Assumptions**
- Clear threat model with adversary capabilities
- Economic parameters and assumptions
- System guarantees (safety, liveness, accountability)

### **3. Cost of 33% Attack (Liveness)**
- Detailed cost breakdown: acquisition, slashing, opportunity, reputation
- Example calculations: $18M-$925M cost depending on token price
- Max potential gain: $0.35M-$17.5M (always unprofitable)
- Three defense mechanisms: high quorum, slashing, social recovery

### **4. Cost of 66% Attack (Safety)**
- Severe price impact analysis (2.5x multiplier for 67% purchase)
- Cost: $70M-$7B depending on token price
- Max double-spend: $5M-$100M (limited by liquidity)
- Always unprofitable by orders of magnitude

### **5. Stake Grinding Prevention**
- Complete VRF design using hash-based construction
- Formal proof that manipulation gains <0.001%
- Withholding analysis: -99% expected value
- Beacon randomness is unmanipulable (requires rewriting history)

### **6. Validator Collusion Prevention**
- Game-theoretic cartel stability analysis
- Cartels unstable for N≥2 validators
- Defection payoff ($66M) >> Cartel share ($4M)
- Whistleblower incentives make defection dominant strategy

### **7. Economic Finality Proofs**
- Formal finality definition and computation
- Four finality levels: Unfinal, Probabilistic, Economic, Absolute
- Timeline: 99.99% confidence after 64 blocks
- Mathematical theorem: P(revert) ≤ 10^-11

### **8. Security Analysis Summary**
- Complete attack cost summary table
- Security margins and confidence levels
- Comparison to Ethereum, Cosmos, Solana, Bitcoin
- Ecliptica is more secure than most PoS chains at launch

## **Key Security Results:**

### **Attack Profitability (Token Price $1.00):**
- 33% Attack: Cost $185M, Gain $3.5M, Net **-$181.5M**
- 66% Attack: Cost $704M, Gain $50M, Net **-$654M**
- Stake Grinding: Cost $100, Gain $1, Net **-$99**
- Cartel Formation: **Unstable** for any size ≥2

### **Finality Confidence:**
- 1 block: 90% (BFT consensus)
- 10 blocks: 99% (exchange safe)
- 64 blocks: 99.9% (economic finality)
- 100,800 blocks (14 days): 99.99% (absolute finality with checkpoints)

The specification proves that Ecliptica is **economically secure** under rational adversary assumptions, with all attack strategies having **strongly negative expected values**!
