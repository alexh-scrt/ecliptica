## **Core Design Choices:**

1. **Hybrid UTXO-Account Model**: Combines the privacy of UTXO (like Zcash) with the efficiency of accounts (like Ethereum) - giving you flexibility for different use cases

2. **Post-Quantum Throughout**: 
   - ML-KEM-512 (Kyber) for encryption
   - ML-DSA (Dilithium-3) for signatures
   - SHAKE-256 for hashing
   - LWE-PRF for deterministic key derivation
   - zk-STARKs (transparent, no trusted setup)

3. **Encrypted State with Proofs**: Balances stay encrypted at rest, but zk-STARK proofs ensure validity without revealing amounts

4. **Deterministic & Canonical**: Everything specified for reproducibility across validators - crucial for consensus

## **Key Technical Innovations:**

- **Nullifier System**: Prevents double-spending in UTXO layer using LWE-based PRFs
- **Encrypted Balance Commitments**: Account balances encrypted with proof-based updates
- **Sparse Merkle Trees**: For efficient inclusion proofs in UTXO set
- **Cross-Layer Conversions**: Shield/unshield operations between UTXO and account layers

## **What Should We Address Next?**

Based on this foundation, the natural next steps are:

1. **Transaction Format** (#2) - Now that we have the state model, we can fully specify transaction structures
2. **zk-STARK Circuit Details** - The constraint system needs more implementation-level detail
3. **Cross-Shard Atomicity** - How does this state model work across shards?
