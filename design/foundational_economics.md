## 🧭 1. Foundational Economic Goals for Ecliptica

Given the philosophy and technical profile of the project:

| Goal                                | Why It Matters                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Quantum-era longevity**           | Ecliptica aims to be a 100-year infrastructure — predictable monetary policy is critical.    |
| **Validator/staker sustainability** | High throughput & zk verification require continuous incentives to maintain security.        |
| **Deflationary optics**             | Attracts holders and institutional capital — especially if marketed as “quantum-hard money.” |
| **Adaptive security**               | Incentives must scale with network value & usage, not just block issuance.                   |
| **Compliance & privacy balance**    | Rewards and emissions should not force identity exposure (use encrypted staking receipts).   |

## ⚖️ 2. Supply Model: Fixed vs. Inflationary

### 🪙 Option A — **Fixed Supply (Bitcoin-style cap)**

**Pros**

* Predictable; easy to model long-term scarcity.
* Psychological “digital gold” effect → strong store-of-value narrative.
* No perpetual dilution of early holders.

**Cons**

* Requires transaction fees alone to sustain validators in the long run.
* Fee markets may be volatile, and zk/STARK proof costs impose real overhead.
* Risk of *security decay* if fees drop below validator cost.

**Best if:** The network’s *execution layer fees* (ZK rollups, L2 settlements, DeFi usage) grow large enough to offset block rewards.

---

### 💹 Option B — **Tail Inflation (Ethereum-style)**

**Pros**

* Sustainable validator income; flexible security budget.
* Easier to calibrate over time via governance.
* Staking yields smooth out user costs; stable block inclusion incentives.

**Cons**

* Slight ongoing dilution; must be offset by network utility/burns.

**Best if:** You want continuous staking participation and economic security decoupled from volatile fee markets.

### 🪶 Option C — **Hybrid “Deflationary-Equilibrium” Model (Recommended)**

A **hard cap + adaptive tail**:

| Component                                                                                       | Description |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Genesis cap:** `10^9 ECLIPT` (1 B coins)                                                      |             |
| **Initial inflation:** 3.5% → decays to 0.5% over 20 years                                      |             |
| **Tail issuance:** ≤ 0.5%/year perpetual (funds validator rewards only)                         |             |
| **Burns:** A portion of all transaction fees and zk-proof posting fees (≈ 0.25–0.5%) are burned |             |
| **Net effect:** Inflation neutral or mildly deflationary depending on usage                     |             |

So:

* Early years → inflation funds network growth.
* Mid term → rewards shift to fees + burns.
* Long term → tail issuance maintains minimum validator security.

This is **closest to Ethereum post-EIP-1559**, but with hard cap optics — “soft capped” equilibrium.

## ⚙️ 3. Reward Mechanics

### 3.1 Validators (Shard + Beacon)

* **Base reward:** Block/epoch subsidy from inflation.
* **Performance reward:** Share of zk-proof verification fees (each verified proof yields a micro-reward).
* **Penalty:** Missed commits, equivocations, or zk-proof delays incur slashing.
* **Distribution:** Weighted by stake and performance (uptime + latency score).

### 3.2 Stakers / Delegators

* **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)** hybrid: users delegate to shard validators.
* **Staking rewards:** Portion of validator inflation (e.g., 70% distributed to stakers).
* **Lock period:** 7–21 days; early unstake incurs fee that is burned.
* **Privacy:** Staking receipts are encrypted (ML-KEM sealed) — delegation relationships not publicly visible.

### 3.3 zk-Provers (Computation Market)

* Separate **proof market** pays out for generating zk-STARKs.
* Funded via:

  * Prover fee baked into transaction costs, or
  * Validator-sponsored “proving pools” that outsource compute to GPU operators.
* Encourages decentralized proof generation without validator centralization.

## 🔄 4. Fee Model

| Fee Type                       | Destination                              | Purpose                         |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Tx fee (base)**              | Burn 30%, reward 70% to shard validators | Aligns usage with scarcity      |
| **zk-proof posting fee**       | Paid to proof producers, 5–10% burned    | Funds off-chain compute         |
| **Cross-shard message fee**    | Paid to both shards’ committees          | Covers additional bandwidth     |
| **Bridge / L2 settlement fee** | Paid to beacon validators                | Supports global recursion costs |

All fee schedules are **predictable and algorithmic**, denominated in ECLIPT.

---

## 🔐 5. Inflation Schedule (Illustrative)

| Year  | Inflation Rate | Max Supply (Cumulative) | Notes                    |
| ----- | -------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 0–5   | 3.5 % → 2.5 %  | 1.13 B                  | Growth & bootstrap phase |
| 5–10  | 2.5 % → 1.5 %  | 1.21 B                  | Stabilization            |
| 10–20 | 1.5 % → 0.5 %  | 1.27 B                  | Mature network           |
| > 20  | ≤ 0.5 % tail   | \~1.30 B cap            | Maintenance only         |

> With periodic burns, total supply will likely *stabilize or contract* around \~1.25 B ECLIPT.

---

## 🏦 6. Treasury & Ecosystem Incentives

* **Protocol Treasury:** 10 % of annual issuance; governed on-chain.

  * Funds R\&D, zk-infrastructure grants, ecosystem apps, and security audits.
* **Validator Onboarding Fund:** 2 % of genesis supply reserved for testnet and bootstrap rewards.
* **DAO Governance:** Inflation tail & fee splits adjustable by quadratic voting (locked-ECLIPT).

## 🔮 7. Target Yields & Economic Equilibrium

| Metric                            | Target                             |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Nominal staking yield (early)** | 10–12 % APR                        |
| **Long-term yield**               | 3–5 % (inflation + fees)           |
| **Average burn rate**             | 0.3–0.7 %                          |
| **Net inflation**                 | ≈ 0 % equilibrium by year 10       |
| **Validator count target**        | ≥ 1,000 active nodes (multi-shard) |

This keeps real yields slightly positive while maintaining long-term scarcity.

## 🧠 8. Recommended Monetary Narrative

> **Ecliptica: The Quantum-Hard Reserve Asset.**
> “A finite, privacy-preserving digital reserve designed to survive both inflation and quantum disruption.”

* 1 B genesis cap, soft-deflationary tail.
* Security through sustainable validator rewards.
* Transparent yet private on-chain economy.
