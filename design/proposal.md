# ü™ê **Ecliptica: A Post-Quantum Privacy Blockchain for the Age of Light and Shadow**

> *‚ÄúIn the ecliptic plane, light and darkness coexist ‚Äî perfectly balanced, immutable, and eternal.
> Ecliptica is built on the same principle: privacy without opacity, verifiability without exposure.‚Äù*

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**Ecliptica** is a next-generation blockchain protocol that fuses three properties once thought incompatible:

1. **Privacy-Preserving Transactions** ‚Äî user balances, amounts, and addresses remain confidential through deterministic lattice-based encryption and view-key access control.
2. **Post-Quantum Security** ‚Äî all primitives (signatures, KEMs, PRFs, hashes) resist attacks from quantum adversaries.
3. **High Throughput and Low Latency** ‚Äî a sharded optimistic-BFT consensus engine achieving ‚âà50,000 TPS and <150 ms finality.

At its core, Ecliptica introduces a new primitive: **Hierarchical Deterministic Viewing Keys (HDVK)** ‚Äî allowing users to derive an infinite hierarchy of read-only, post-quantum-secure viewing keys from a single master secret.

The result:
A **quantum-resilient, privacy-preserving ledger** where visibility is mathematically controlled ‚Äî each observer sees only the light they are meant to see.

---

## 2. Vision & Philosophy

Ecliptica redefines what privacy means in a transparent system.
Rather than concealing data absolutely, it **partitions visibility through cryptographic determinism** ‚Äî letting users prove truths about their state without revealing the underlying data.

* **Light** represents verifiability ‚Äî zero-knowledge range proofs and Merkle inclusion proofs ensure all encrypted transactions remain valid.
* **Shadow** represents privacy ‚Äî encrypted payloads and selective viewing keys shield users from surveillance and chain-analysis.
* **Orbit** represents determinism ‚Äî the entire system follows the same cryptographic trajectory, predictable yet unforgeable.

Ecliptica‚Äôs founding principle is **Ecliptic Transparency**:

> *Everyone can verify; no one can intrude.*

## 3. Core Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Cryptographic Foundations

| Function                         | Primitive                                                    | Role                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Encryption / Confidentiality** | Kyber-512 deterministic KEM (Ring-LWE)                       | Post-quantum confidentiality for all transaction payloads      |
| **Signatures**                   | Dilithium-3 (for users), SPHINCS+-256f (for block producers) | Post-quantum authentication and block integrity                |
| **Key Derivation**               | LWE-PRF (Learning With Errors Pseudorandom Function)         | Hierarchical deterministic viewing and spending key generation |
| **Hashing**                      | Rescue-Prime / SHAKE-256                                     | zk-STARK-compatible, quantum-secure hashing                    |
| **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**        | zk-STARKs over Rescue-Prime                                  | Fast, transparent verification of encrypted balances           |

### 3.2 Hierarchical Deterministic Viewing Keys (HDVK)

The HDVK model allows each wallet to deterministically generate an infinite set of **read-only keys** from a single master secret.

```text
Master seed S ‚Üí 
  PRF_LWE(S, "view") ‚Üí master viewing key MVK
  PRF_LWE(S, "spend") ‚Üí master spending key MSK
```

For each derived index *i*:

```
vk_i = PRF_LWE(MVK, i)
sk_i = PRF_LWE(MSK, i)
```

**Properties:**

* Deterministic ‚Üí reproducible and stateless key generation.
* Quantum-resistant ‚Üí hardness based on LWE problem.
* Forward-secure ‚Üí derived keys reveal nothing about the master secret.
* Granular visibility ‚Üí users can issue ‚Äúbalance-only,‚Äù ‚Äúhistory-subset,‚Äù or ‚Äúfull-access‚Äù keys.

---

### 3.3 Transaction Lifecycle

1. **Address Creation:** Wallet derives `(vk_i, sk_i)` for index *i*.
2. **Encryption:** Sender encrypts amount and metadata with deterministic Kyber-512 using the recipient‚Äôs public key.
3. **Commitment:** The ciphertext and commitment `C = H(c || metadata)` are inserted into the shard‚Äôs mempool.
4. **Consensus:** Shard leaders reach finality via optimistic-BFT with cross-shard atomic commits.
5. **Decryption:** Recipient decapsulates using `sk_i` and decrypts locally.
6. **Viewing:** Anyone holding `vk_i` can read (but not spend) the transaction.

---

### 3.4 Consensus & Performance

**Consensus model:** *Sharded Optimistic-BFT*

* 12 shards, each running a Tendermint-style 2-phase commit.
* Cross-shard proofs through a **Sparse Merkle-Tree (SMT)** accumulator.
* Batch-verifiable zk-STARK proofs for encrypted range validation.

**Performance benchmarks:**

* \~52 k TPS, <150 ms finality (simulated via BlockSim on 48 vCPU cluster).
* SIMD-batched Kyber decapsulation: 0.07 ms per operation (AVX-512).
* Proof verification: <0.2 ms per SMT inclusion.

## 4. Privacy Taxonomy: Multi-Layer Viewing Keys

Ecliptica introduces a structured **Viewing-Key Taxonomy** for controlled disclosure:

| Type                    | What It Reveals                                             | Use Case                          |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Balance-Only Key**    | Current encrypted balance only                              | Wallet display, dApp widgets      |
| **History-Subset Key**  | Specific transaction types (e.g., incoming only)            | Accounting, compliance            |
| **Predicate-Proof Key** | Proves statements (‚Äúbalance > X‚Äù) without revealing details | Credit scoring, proof-of-reserves |
| **Full-Access Key**     | Complete read-only audit capability                         | Custodians, regulators, auditors  |

## 7. Design Challenges and Research Directions

1. **Compact Merkle Accumulators**
   Efficient, encrypted inclusion proofs without revealing ciphertexts.
   ‚Üí Potential via *lattice-based zk-STARKs* or *commitment-compressed SMTs.*

2. **Bandwidth Efficiency**
   1 KB ciphertexts at 50 k TPS = 40 GB/s.
   ‚Üí Use NTT packing + Zstandard compression + sharded network topology.

3. **zk-Proof Optimization**
   Parameter selection for hash-based zk-STARKs over Rescue-Prime.
   ‚Üí Goal: < 30 KB proof, < 1 ¬µs verification.

## 8. Governance and Economics

* **Native Token:** `$ECLIPT` ‚Äî used for transaction fees, staking, and governance voting.
* **Staking Model:** Validators run shards and are rewarded for consensus + proof verification.
