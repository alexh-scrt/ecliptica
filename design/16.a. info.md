## **Key Sections:**

### **1. Quantum Computer Breakthrough Response (Section 2)**
Complete 7-day migration procedure:
- **Threat detection** with confidence assessment
- **Emergency committee activation** (10 members, 7-of-10 multi-sig)
- **Network freeze** at coordinated height
- **Cryptography upgrade** to stronger parameters (ML-DSA-87, ML-KEM-1024, SHAKE-512)
- **State re-encryption** in 1000 batches over 2-4 days
- **Validator key rotation** with migration certificates
- **Coordinated restart** with new genesis

**Timeline**: Detection (0-24h) → Committee (6h) → Freeze (24h) → Migration (3-4 days) → Restart (7 days total)

### **2. Critical Vulnerability Disclosure (Section 3)**
Four-severity classification with specific timelines:

| Severity     | Private Disclosure | Validator Notification | Public Disclosure | Patch        |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| **Critical** | Immediate          | 0-6 hours              | After 67% patched | 0-24h        |
| **High**     | 0-24h              | 1-7 days               | 7-14 days         | 1-3 days     |
| **Medium**   | 0-7 days           | N/A                    | 30 days           | 1-2 weeks    |
| **Low**      | 0-30 days          | N/A                    | Immediate         | Next release |

**Bug Bounty Program**:
- Critical: 100,000 ECLIPT
- High: 25,000 ECLIPT
- Medium: 5,000 ECLIPT
- Low: 1,000 ECLIPT
- Maximum: 500,000 ECLIPT

### **3. Network Halt and Restart (Section 4)**
Four halt triggers with different procedures:
- **Consensus failure** - Immediate halt
- **State corruption** - Rollback and repair
- **Active exploit** - Emergency patch
- **Validator vote** - Democratic halt (67% threshold)

**Restart types**:
- Clean restart (continue from halt)
- Rollback (revert N blocks)
- State repair (fix corruption)
- Hard fork (new genesis)

### **4. State Snapshot and Recovery (Section 5)**
Four snapshot types:
- **Scheduled**: Every N blocks (configurable)
- **Emergency**: On network halt
- **Pre-upgrade**: Before major upgrades
- **Manual**: Operator-initiated

**Storage strategy**:
- Local storage + remote backups (S3, GCS, IPFS)
- Zstd compression for efficiency
- Retention policy (max snapshots, max age)
- Integrity verification with signatures

**Recovery procedure**:
1. Load snapshot (with verification)
2. Decompress data
3. Restore accounts, contracts, validators
4. Verify state root matches
5. Resume operations

### **5. Validator Key Compromise (Section 6)**
Four compromise indicators:
- Unauthorized transactions
- Equivocation (double-signing)
- Self-reported compromise
- Anomalous behavior patterns

**Emergency rotation procedure** (<12 hours):
1. Detect compromise
2. Freeze validator immediately
3. Generate new keypair
4. Multi-sig authorization (7-of-10)
5. Broadcast rotation
6. Slash if malicious

**Key rotation policy**:
- Scheduled: Every 90 days
- Emergency: Within 1 hour
- Grace period: 1 hour for update

### **6. Communication Protocols (Section 7)**
Multi-channel emergency communication:
- Discord emergency channel
- Telegram emergency group
- Twitter official account
- Validator email list
- On-chain announcements
- Status page

**Notification severity levels**:
- Informational (FYI)
- Warning (action recommended)
- Urgent (action required soon)
- Critical (immediate action)

### **7. Post-Incident Analysis (Section 8)**
Comprehensive post-mortem template:
- Timeline analysis
- Impact assessment
- Root cause analysis
- Response evaluation
- Lessons learned
- Corrective actions
- Preventive actions

**Continuous improvement**:
- Create GitHub issues
- Update documentation
- Refine procedures
- Schedule drills

### **8. Testing and Drills (Section 9)**
Three drill types:
- **Tabletop**: Discussion exercises
- **Simulated**: Testnet execution
- **Live**: Announced mainnet drills

**Drill schedule**:
- Quantum threat: Annually (tabletop)
- Critical vulnerability: Quarterly (simulated)
- Network halt: Semi-annually (simulated)
- State corruption: Annually (simulated)
- Validator compromise: Quarterly (tabletop)

## **Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)**:

- Network halt: **<2 hours**
- State rollback: **<4 hours**
- Emergency patch: **<24 hours**
- Quantum migration: **<7 days**
- Validator key rotation: **<12 hours**

## **Key Technical Innovations**:

1. **Quantum threat levels** with graduated response procedures
2. **Multi-sig emergency committee** (10 members, 7-of-10 threshold)
3. **Automated compromise detection** with anomaly scoring
4. **State re-encryption in batches** for large-scale migration
5. **Migration certificates** proving validator identity across crypto upgrades
6. **Coordinated restart** with grace periods for validator preparation

This fills the **Disaster Recovery** design gap completely with:
- ✅ Quantum computer breakthrough response (7-day procedure)
- ✅ Critical vulnerability disclosure process (coordinated disclosure)
- ✅ Network halt and restart procedure (4 restart types)
- ✅ State snapshot and recovery (4 snapshot types with remote backup)
- ✅ Validator key compromise handling (<12 hour rotation)
