## **Key Sections:**

### **1-2. Economic Model**
- Complete parameter definitions (inflation, rewards, slashing)
- Staking dynamics with precise numbers

### **3. Nash Equilibrium Analysis**
- Formal strategy space for validators and delegators
- Payoff matrix showing Honest strategy dominates all attacks
- Mathematical proof that honest validation is optimal
- Expected utility calculations for all strategies

### **4. Attack Cost vs Profit Analysis**
- Detailed taxonomy of 6 attack types
- Cost models for solo, cartel, and supermajority attacks
- Real calculations showing attacks are economically irrational
- Summary table: All attacks have negative expected value

### **5. Nothing-at-Stake Prevention**
- Three-layer defense: slashing, finality gadget, weak subjectivity
- Game-theoretic proof showing signing both forks is dominated
- Expected value calculation: E[dishonest] â‰ˆ -0.04948S << E[honest]

### **6. Long-Range Attack Prevention**
- Three defense mechanisms: checkpoints, forward security, key evolution
- Economic analysis showing deep rewrites cost >$1M with $0 gain
- Shallow rewrites still unprofitable due to social consensus

### **7. Weak Subjectivity Checkpoints**
- Complete checkpoint format and generation process
- Multi-source distribution (Foundation API, GitHub, DNS, etc.)
- Verification requirements (foundation + 3 core devs)
- 14-day checkpoint intervals

### **8. Performance Incentives**
- Performance coefficient formula (uptime 50%, latency 30%, correctness 20%)
- Reward calculations for validators and delegators
- Reputation system (0-100 score based on history)

### **9. Slashing Mechanisms**
- Four slashing event types with evidence formats
- Precise slashing amounts (5% double-sign, 0.1-0.5% downtime)
- Execution flow with whistleblower rewards

### **10. Economic Security Thresholds**
- Minimum viable security calculations
- Required stake ratios for different TVL levels
- Optimal staking range: 50-80% of supply

### **11. Formal Security Guarantees**
- **Theorem 1**: Honest validation strictly dominates for V < 0.67S
- **Theorem 2**: Cartel attacks are unprofitable
- Complete mathematical proofs in appendix

### **12. Simulation Results**
- Monte Carlo analysis: 0% attack success rate in 10,000 trials
- Network health metrics showing 99.5% uptime, 65% stake ratio

### **13. Recommendations**
- Actionable advice for validators, delegators, and governance

## **Key Security Results:**

| Token Price | 33% Attack Cost | 67% Attack Cost |
| ----------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| $0.10       | $35M            | $1.1B           |
| $1.00       | $350M           | $11B            |
| $10.00      | $3.5B           | $110B           |

**Conclusion**: All attack strategies have negative expected value, making Ecliptica economically secure under rational validator assumptions!
