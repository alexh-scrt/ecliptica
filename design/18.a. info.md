## **Key Sections:**

### **1. Bridge Architecture Overview (Section 2)**
Three-layer architecture:
- **Bridge Validator Set (BVS)**: 64 independent validators with 100K ECLIPT minimum stake
- **Relayer Network**: Permissionless relayers earn fees for message delivery
- **Bridge Contracts**: Lock-Mint and Burn-Unlock mechanisms on each chain

**Supported Chains**: Ethereum, Cosmos, Solana, Polygon, Arbitrum

### **2. Bridge Validator Set (Section 3)**
**Validator Requirements**:
- Minimum stake: 100,000 ECLIPT (~$10K at $0.10/ECLIPT)
- Total set size: 64 validators
- Approval threshold: 67% of stake
- ML-DSA post-quantum signatures

**Validator Economics**:
- Election by highest stake
- Rotation every ~1 day (86,400 blocks)
- Performance tracking (messages signed/missed)
- Slashing for malicious behavior

### **3. Cross-Chain Message Verification (Section 4)**
**Message Format** includes:
- Encrypted payload with ML-KEM
- Merkle proof from source chain
- Validator signatures (67% threshold)
- Relayer information and fees
- Expiry timestamp

**Verification Process** (6 steps):
1. Validate message format
2. Verify source chain inclusion proof
3. Verify validator signatures (ML-DSA)
4. Check 67% stake threshold
5. Verify not expired
6. Verify not already processed

**Light Client Support**: For chains with light client infrastructure (Ethereum, Cosmos)

### **4. Relayer Incentives (Section 5)**
**Economic Model**:
- Base fee: 1 ECLIPT per message
- Gas reimbursement for destination chain
- Speed bonus: 1.5× for relays <1 minute
- Volume bonus: 1.2× for >100 relays/week

**Relayer Marketplace**:
- Open participation (permissionless)
- Performance metrics (success rate, avg time)
- Reputation scoring
- Competitive fee market

### **5. Fraud Proof Mechanism (Section 6)**
**Five Fraud Types**:
1. **Invalid source proof** - Wrong state root
2. **Double minting** - Same message processed twice
3. **Invalid signature** - Forged validator signature
4. **Unauthorized mint** - Mint without source lock
5. **Incorrect asset mapping** - Wrong asset bridged

**Fraud Response**:
- Automatic validator slashing
- 30-day jail period
- Reward to fraud submitter (10% of slashed amount)
- Temporary bridge halt for critical fraud
- False accusation penalty: 100 ECLIPT

### **6. Bridge Contract Specifications (Section 7)**
**Ecliptica Bridge Contract** (Rust):
- `lock_and_bridge()` - Lock assets and emit message
- `process_bridge_message()` - Process incoming from external chain
- `unlock_assets()` - Unlock after burn proof

**Ethereum Bridge Contract** (Solidity):
- `lockAndBridge()` - Lock ETH/ERC20 for Ecliptica
- `unlockAssets()` - Unlock after validator approval
- Multi-signature verification (67% threshold)

### **7. Security Analysis (Section 8)**
**Attack Vector Coverage**:

| Attack               | Mitigation                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 51% validator attack | Economic security (attack cost = 67% stake) |
| Relayer censorship   | Marketplace competition + timeout fallback  |
| Double minting       | Message ID tracking + fraud proofs          |
| Fake source proof    | Light client verification                   |
| Bridge halt          | Independent validator set                   |
| Wrapped asset depeg  | Collateral monitoring                       |
| Cross-chain replay   | Unique message IDs per chain                |

**Economic Security**:
- Total bridge stake: 6.4M ECLIPT (64 × 100K)
- Attack cost (67%): 4.3M ECLIPT (~$430K at $0.10)
- Max locked assets: 2.1M ECLIPT with 2× safety margin
- Recommended max bridge value: $100-200K initially

### **8. Bridge Monitoring (Section 9)**
**Tracked Metrics**:
- Validator participation rate
- Message relay times
- Peg ratio (wrapped vs native)
- Fraud proof submissions
- Validator slashing events

**Automated Alerts**:
- Low validator participation (<67%)
- Peg deviation (>5%)
- High relay failure rate (>10%)
- Fraud detected

## **Key Technical Innovations**:

1. **Post-quantum bridge** with ML-DSA signatures throughout
2. **Independent validator set** separate from consensus validators
3. **Economic fraud proofs** with automatic slashing
4. **Relayer marketplace** with competitive incentives
5. **Light client verification** for trustless bridge operation
6. **Encrypted cross-chain transfers** maintaining privacy
7. **Multi-chain support** with unified architecture

## **Security Properties**:

✓ **Trust-minimized**: No single point of failure  
✓ **Economically secure**: Attack cost >> potential profit  
✓ **Fraud resistant**: Automatic detection and slashing  
✓ **Censorship resistant**: Open relayer marketplace  
✓ **Post-quantum secure**: ML-DSA signatures  
✓ **Privacy-preserving**: Encrypted payloads  

This fills the **Bridge Security Model** design gap completely with:
- ✅ Bridge validator set (64 validators, 100K ECLIPT stake, 67% threshold)
- ✅ Cross-chain message verification (6-step process with ML-DSA signatures)
- ✅ Relayer incentives (base fee + bonuses, marketplace model)
- ✅ Fraud proof mechanism (5 fraud types with automatic slashing)
- ✅ Bridge contract specifications (Ecliptica Rust + Ethereum Solidity)
