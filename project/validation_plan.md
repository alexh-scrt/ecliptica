# 🔬 **Ecliptica Core Assumptions Validation Plan**

## **Executive Summary**

Before committing to full implementation, we must validate the fundamental technical assumptions underlying Ecliptica's design. This 3-6 month validation phase will prove or disprove core hypotheses through targeted prototypes and benchmarks.

**Goal:** Determine if Ecliptica's ambitious performance targets are achievable with current cryptographic primitives and hardware.

## 📋 **Critical Assumptions to Validate**

### **Assumption 1: Post-Quantum STARK Performance**
**Claim:** Can generate zk-STARK proofs for encrypted transactions in <2 seconds on consumer hardware
- **Risk:** If proof generation takes >10 seconds, target TPS becomes infeasible
- **Impact:** CRITICAL - entire architecture depends on this

### **Assumption 2: Encrypted State Execution**
**Claim:** Smart contracts can execute on encrypted state with <10× performance overhead
- **Risk:** May require FHE (1000× overhead) making it impractical
- **Impact:** CRITICAL - core privacy feature

### **Assumption 3: Threshold Decryption Latency**
**Claim:** 67-of-100 threshold decryption adds <500ms latency
- **Risk:** Network coordination could add seconds of delay
- **Impact:** HIGH - affects MEV protection and UX

### **Assumption 4: Cross-Shard Throughput**
**Claim:** Can achieve <5 second cross-shard finality with optimistic execution
- **Risk:** Fraud detection may require longer challenge periods
- **Impact:** HIGH - affects scalability claims

### **Assumption 5: Light Client Sync Speed**
**Claim:** Mobile devices can sync chain state in <30 seconds
- **Risk:** ML-DSA signature verification may be too slow on mobile
- **Impact:** MEDIUM - affects decentralization claims

## 📝 **Final Recommendation**

**This validation phase is CRITICAL before committing to full implementation.** The outcomes will either:

1. **Validate the architecture** → Proceed to $10-20M Phase 1 implementation
2. **Identify needed pivots** → Adjust design, re-validate critical components
3. **Reveal fundamental issues** → Major redesign or project cancellation

**Expected Outcome:** Based on solid cryptographic foundations, estimate **70% chance of successful validation** with some architectural adjustments needed.
